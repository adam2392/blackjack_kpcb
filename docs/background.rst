Background on Blackjack and Game
=====================================

Blackjack is a game between yourself and the dealer. I've always been fascinated with the idea of blackjack
and how it is a game that is statistically beatable. In addition, it also has one of the best
house-edges of any casino game (i.e. least losses over a long period of time). Built around that
is something called "basic strategy". Basic strategy is a set of rules that are encoded for taking
an action every time based on what your hand is and what the dealer's face up card is.

For example, if I have two Ace's, and the dealer has any card 2-Ace, then I will always perform a split (p). If
I have a total of 9 from my first two cards, adn the dealer has any card 3-6, then I will always double (d).
